# Gaming Stock TrendForecast
The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, trend analysis, and time series prediction using a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network.

Here's a breakdown of the main components and steps in the code:

Importing Libraries and Data: The code begins by importing various Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, and Torch. It also imports the stock price data for Activision Blizzard, Ubisoft, and Nintendo from CSV files.

Data Preprocessing: The code performs some initial data preprocessing tasks, including setting the 'Date' column as the index, handling missing values in the Ubisoft dataset, and checking the structure and summary statistics of the datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The code creates various visualizations using Plotly and Seaborn to analyze the distribution of closing prices, scatter plots of open vs. close prices, and time series plots for each company's stock attributes. These visualizations provide insights into the historical trends and patterns in the stock prices.

Trend Analysis and Seasonality: The code uses the seasonal_decompose function from Statsmodels to decompose the time series data of each company's stock prices into trend, seasonal, and residual components. This helps identify underlying patterns and trends in the data.

Time Series Prediction with GRU: The code moves on to predict future stock prices using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network. The stock prices are scaled using MinMaxScaler, and the data is split into training and testing sets. The GRU model is defined using PyTorch, and the training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

Visualization of Predictions: The code creates visualizations to compare the original stock prices with the predicted prices using the trained GRU model. It also plots the training loss over epochs to visualize the model's training progress.

Performance Evaluation: The code calculates and prints the root mean squared error (RMSE) for both the training and testing datasets. The RMSE provides an indication of how well the GRU model's predictions match the actual stock prices.

Prediction Result Visualization: The code visualizes the training and testing predictions along with the actual stock prices for both Activision Blizzard and Nintendo using a Plotly line chart. The chart shows how well the GRU model's predictions align with the actual data.

Overall, the code snippet showcases a comprehensive analysis and prediction process for stock prices, from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to training and evaluating a GRU neural network model. It focuses on two companies, Activision Blizzard and Nintendo, and provides insights into their stock price trends and predictive performance.
